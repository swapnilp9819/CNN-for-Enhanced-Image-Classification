# Convolutional Neural Networks for Enhanced Image Classification

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The project leverages unique CNN architectures and training strategies to improve classification accuracy, providing insights into effective neural network structures for image recognition tasks.

## Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset is used in this project, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes (6,000 images per class). The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, covering varied categories such as airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, and more.

### Dataset Accessibility
The CIFAR-10 dataset is publicly available and can be accessed [here](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

## Project Structure
The project is structured into a Jupyter Notebook that contains the complete codebase, segmented into distinct sections for clarity and ease of understanding:
- **Data Preparation**: Includes data loading and augmentation techniques.
- **Model Architecture**: Details the construction of the CNN including intermediate blocks and output layers.
- **Training Process**: Covers the training loop, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.
- **Results**: Discusses the outcomes of the training process and the effectiveness of the model.

## File Description
- **CNN_for_Enhanced_Image_Classification.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook that contains all the code for data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

## Implementation Details
- **CNN Architecture**: The model uses a sequence of intermediate blocks followed by an output block. Each block integrates multiple convolutional layers with activation functions, normalization, and pooling.
- **Training**: The model is trained using cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer, with a learning rate scheduler to adjust the learning rate during training.
- **Evaluation**: Performance is evaluated based on accuracy metrics on both training and testing sets.

## Key Results
The implemented CNN achieved a maximum testing accuracy of 85.06% on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The architecture proved effective in generalizing from the training data to unseen data, highlighting the robustness of the model against overfitting.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `CNN_for_Enhanced_Image_Classification.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment.
3. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (`torch`, `torchvision`).
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially to replicate the training process and model evaluation.

## Libraries and Dependencies
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- matplotlib (for plotting training and testing accuracies)

## Tip
Given the dataset's size and the computational demands of training a CNN, it is recommended to use a GPU to significantly reduce computation time and facilitate more efficient model training.

## Conclusion
This project underscores the capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks in accurately classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset through a well-architected model and effective training strategies. The CNN model's ability to generalize provides a strong foundation for further research and application in broader image classification tasks.
